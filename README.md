# Netflix vs Disney Series a pytrends and Flourish Mini-Project

In the past few months Netflix has been subject to numerous criticisms, the basis of which range from its business practices to issues with the service it provides, including content issues and the drop of many series after their season 1. Because of that, Netflix's domination as a streaming service has started to decline due to its multiple competitors, Disney+, HBO, Amazon's Prime, Hulu, etc. 

To be honest, Netflix's main competitor is definitely Disney+, Disney has improved significantly over the past few years. Its library includes Marvel Studios, the Star Wars franchise, Pixar, Disney, and National Geographic. Currently, there are also rumors about Disney+ surpassing Netflix on total active subscribers.

However, a streaming service's power is its content. Netflix still holds some powerful IPs that have seen tremendous popularity over the years, including Stranger Things. In this repository, I will try to naively compare these two streaming services. This project will start as a basic analysis of some data from Google's trends, based on how many times a particular series has been Googled in 2022. The goal will be to create interactive plots using Flourish and Python in order to compare Netflix's most popular shows for 2022 with Disney's most popular show for 2022.

Some prior analysis for selecting these 5 shows have already been done. It has been identified that the most Googled shows for Netflix (this doesn't include movies) for 2022 were: Stranger Things, Umbrella Academy, Peaky Blinders and Bridgerton. On the other hand the most popular show for Disney was, I was quite surprised, Marvel's Moon Knight.

## Future Work
The plan for this project is to grow arms and legs over time. This includes further analysis using data from different data sources and maybe include some spicy ML prediction models or a recommendation system.
